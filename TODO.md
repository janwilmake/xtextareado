- People should be able to see the main person is doing by having my the profilepic on the filename if present.

# Custom named generations?

Just like the prompt button, what if we had a button to see the last-generated outcome in gptideas? Since hyphens aren't allowed in X usernames, what if https://{filename}-janwilmake.xytext.com would be tied to the generation? Maybe this is what I'm ACTUALLY LOOKING FOR?

- In lmpify, choosing a name is likely an awkward experience, whereas in a file editor it's much more intuitive.
- In lmpify we can choose the model, in xytext, maybe we should provide it as built-in thing we just know works, and has a built-in system prompt!
