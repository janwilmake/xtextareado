Can you make a html with monaco editor js that for certain hardcoded words in a hardcoded vocabulary it:

- autocomplete will show the words. default autocomplete words should be removed
- makes them blue. ensure also new text typed will type it blue
- has hover intellisense for it with a definition
- cmd+click would navigate to google that word
