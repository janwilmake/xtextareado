every day, im doing actions in the browser, vscode, and terminal. i have a few macos tools i use atop of these programs but that is 95%. im confident that if i can do vscode and the terminal in the browser - i can stop using macos and move to a browser-only OS, or i can just use safari only. I would never need to leave it.

however, then I'd still not be able to observe myself without having something for that

I COULD use my own apps only, and i'd be able to let the app itself observe me and give that information back to me, not using it for own interest. This removes the need to install any extensions and other client-dependent setup. This seems to be the most low-friction path if everyone would adopt it.
